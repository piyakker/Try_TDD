# Build An Api Using TDD Approach
This is a simple RESTful Api project.
I use TDD approach to develop this User Api with the guide of [Wes Doyle's Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULJ3UEezisw&t=2933s), which is very educative.

## Environment
```
- Windows11
- .NET 6.0
- xUnit 2.4.2
- Moq 4.20.27
- FluentAssertions 6.12.0
```
